# PVE-UPS

**GUI-based UPS shutdown appliance for Proxmox VE — a NUT alternative with a web wizard
and no config files.**

*Deutsche Fassung: [README.de.md](README.de.md)*

PVE-UPS monitors one or more UPS devices — **with an SNMP network card (standard RFC 1628
or a vendor MIB such as APC PowerNet)** or **through a NUT server**, which is how USB and
serial UPS devices are read — and, on a power outage, shuts down one or more **Proxmox VE
hosts** in an orderly fashion. The modern replacement for vendor-locked appliances such as APC
PowerChute Network Shutdown. Everything is configured through a **web wizard**; monitoring
is available as **REST/JSON**.

## Why not NUT?

[NUT](https://networkupstools.org/) has excellent hardware support, but for the common
"shut my Proxmox hosts down when the UPS runs low" case it means `upsd`/`upsmon` config
files and custom shutdown scripting on every host. PVE-UPS takes the appliance approach
instead — and where NUT hardware support is what you need, it uses NUT as a *driver*
rather than replacing it:

- **One LXC, one installer** — an unprivileged Debian container (~256 MB RAM) created by a
  single command on the PVE host.
- **No config files** — a web wizard with test buttons for every step; settings apply live.
- **No agents on the hosts** — shutdown goes through the Proxmox API using a dedicated,
  revocable **API token** with only the `Sys.PowerMgmt` privilege. No root SSH anywhere.
- **Vendor-neutral, but not naive about vendors** — the standard RFC 1628 UPS MIB via
  SNMP v1/v2c/v3 (pure-Python, no net-snmp), automatically switching to a vendor MIB where
  the standard falls short (APC PowerNet), or any existing NUT server as a read-only client.
- **NUT stays a driver, never the brain** — PVE-UPS only ever reads variables from `upsd`.
  No `upsmon`, no `upssched`, no shutdown scripts: the thresholds, the host policy and the
  decision stay in the appliance, where you can see them.

## Installation

Run in the **Proxmox node shell** (web UI → node → `>_ Shell`, as root). The script
downloads the latest release, unpacks it and creates the LXC:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/ffind-dev/pve-ups/releases/latest/download/install.sh)"
# with options, e.g. a static IP:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ffind-dev/pve-ups/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --ctid 950 --ip 10.0.0.50/24 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --hostname pve-usv
```

PVE-UPS is also listed on [community-scripts.org](https://community-scripts.org/) (search
for "PVE-UPS") — a community-maintained collection of Proxmox helper scripts. The one-liner
above stays the reference path.

Then open the web UI at **`http://<container-ip>:8080`**:
1. Set the UI password.
2. Walk through the wizard (UPS devices → hosts → thresholds → optional webhook).
3. While **dry-run** is active nothing is shut down — ideal for testing.
4. When everything checks out: **disable dry-run** (mode "ARMED").

> The LXC typically runs on one of the protected hosts. Mark that host as **"This host"**
> in the host list — it is then guaranteed to shut down last.

## Docker (alternative deployment)

Prefer not to run an LXC? A prebuilt image is published on every release to
[`ghcr.io/ffind-dev/pve-ups`](https://github.com/ffind-dev/pve-ups/pkgs/container/pve-ups):

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffind-dev/pve-ups/main/docker-compose.example.yml
mv docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

This mounts two named volumes (`/etc/pve-usv` for the config, `/var/lib/pve-usv` for the
event log/state) so data survives container recreation. Open
`http://<container-host>:8080` and run through the wizard as usual.

**Docker mode has two differences from the LXC deployment**, because there is no
privileged companion process (no systemd) inside the image:
- **No in-app updates.** The "Upload update package" button is hidden; update by
  pulling a new image tag and recreating the container
  (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`). Config and event log persist in the
  volumes.
- **No NTP/timezone management from the wizard.** Time and timezone are the
  Docker host's/orchestrator's responsibility — **set `TZ` on the container** (the example
  Compose file does). The self-test schedule runs in the container's local time, and
  without `TZ` the container runs in UTC.

> **If your network lies within `172.17.0.0/16` – `172.31.0.0/16`**, move Docker's default
> address pool *before* starting the container — Docker claims that range for its bridges,
> and the container would no longer reach a UPS or Proxmox host in it. In
> `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
> `{"bip":"10.210.0.1/24","default-address-pools":[{"base":"10.211.0.0/16","size":24}]}`,
> then `systemctl restart docker`.

Everything else (SNMP polling, Proxmox shutdown, thresholds, webhook, self-test) works
identically to the LXC deployment. The LXC install (above) remains the primary, fully
self-updating path.

## Connecting the Proxmox hosts (API token)

The appliance shuts hosts down through the Proxmox API — no root SSH, no agent on the
host. It needs a dedicated user with a **single privilege** (`Sys.PowerMgmt`) and an API
token. Run **once** in a node shell (as root):

```bash
# 1) dedicated user (PVE realm)
pveum user add ups@pve

# 2) role that carries only the power-management privilege
pveum role add UpsShutdown -privs "Sys.PowerMgmt"

# 3) grant the role on /nodes (or narrower: /nodes/<name>)
pveum acl modify /nodes -user ups@pve -role UpsShutdown

# 4) create the API token — privilege separation OFF, so the token inherits the privilege
pveum user token add ups@pve shutdown --privsep 0
```

The last command prints the **token ID** (`ups@pve!shutdown`) and the **secret** (a UUID,
shown only this once — copy it now). Enter both in the wizard under **Proxmox hosts**
(API URL is `https://<host-ip>:8006`) and check the connection with **Test**.

- **In a cluster, run the commands only once, on any node.** Users, API tokens and ACLs
  live at datacenter level (`/etc/pve`) and are therefore valid on every node — enter the
  *same* token ID and secret for each node you add. On standalone hosts that share no
  cluster, repeat the commands per host.
- Give every host entry **its own API URL** (`https://<this-node-ip>:8006`). The API would
  proxy a request to another node, but a node that has already been shut down cannot proxy
  for the ones still to come.
- Leave **Verify TLS** off as long as the host uses Proxmox's self-signed certificate.
- The token is revocable at any time: `pveum user token remove ups@pve shutdown`.

## Features

- **Multiple UPS devices** per instance with host↔UPS mapping and per-host logic
  (**AND** = redundant power supplies, **OR** = split load), including a live feed diagram.
- **Two UPS sources**, freely mixable in one instance:
  - **SNMP v1/v2c and v3** (authPriv), read-only. Reads the standard RFC 1628 UPS MIB or a
    **vendor MIB** — currently **APC PowerNet**, which is what makes APC cards work that
    implement RFC 1628 partially (NMC2 below firmware sumx/sy v5.1.7) or not at all (NMC1:
    AP9617/AP9618/AP9619). Picked automatically per UPS; selectable by hand.
  - **NUT server** (TCP 3493) as a read-only client — for UPS devices without a network
    card. Works with the UPS server built into a Synology/QNAP/TrueNAS NAS, a Raspberry
    Pi, OPNsense, or a NUT install on a Proxmox host. QNAP and Synology prescribe their own
    values (QNAP: UPS name `qnapups`, user `admin`, password `123456`; Synology: UPS name
    and user `ups`, no password) and only answer hosts on their permitted-devices list —
    see the manual, section 5.
- **Web wizard** for UPS devices, hosts, thresholds and notifications — with test buttons;
  the UPS test breaks its result down per object, so a missing OID or NUT variable, wrong
  credentials and a blocked port are told apart at a glance. It also names the trigger
  conditions the device cannot feed at all, so no threshold is left silently dead.
- **Bilingual UI**: English (default) and German, picked automatically from the browser
  language; user manual built in (both languages).
- Per-UPS **threshold overrides** on top of the global defaults.
- **Webhook notifications** on notable events, as full status JSON, a **Microsoft Teams**
  adaptive card or plain text — with a severity filter and a test-send button.
- **REST status** (`/api/status`, `/api/health`) — read-only, no auth, no secrets;
  event log of the last 48 h included. Event/webhook texts are uniformly English.
- **Config export/import**, NTP/timezone setup, scheduled Proxmox connectivity self-test
  (start time plus an interval from 15 min to 24 h), in-place **updates via package
  upload** in the web UI.

## Safety model

- **Fail-safe by default:** losing contact with the UPS is *not* a confirmed power outage —
  it raises an alarm and never shuts anything down. The same holds for a NUT server that
  answers with stale data because its driver died: that counts as unreachable, never as
  "on mains". Two explicit opt-ins refine this:
  continuing a confirmed on-battery countdown through a connection loss (default on),
  and treating a prolonged pure communication loss as an outage (default off).
- **Dry-run by default:** after installation the engine only logs what it would do.
  A **test shutdown** simulates the shutdown order without any effect.
- A confirmed trigger and the on-battery countdown are **persisted to disk** and survive
  a service restart.
- **"Own host last":** the host carrying the appliance is always shut down last.
- The app runs **unprivileged**; a slim privileged companion applies updates and
  NTP/timezone changes. Secrets never leave the appliance via the API.

## Default triggers

**One** matching condition is enough (all editable in the wizard; empty field = off):

| Condition | Default |
|---|---|
| On battery longer than | 600 s |
| Runtime below | 10 min |
| Charge below | 30 % |
| UPS reports `battery low/depleted` | on |

Poll interval: 30 s on mains, 8 s on battery.

## Updates

Download the release asset (`pve-usv-<version>.tar.gz`) from the
[releases page](https://github.com/ffind-dev/pve-ups/releases) and upload it in the web UI
under **Update**. The configuration is preserved; the service restarts automatically.
Updating from 2.x works the same way (see the manual for the two behaviour changes).
Running in Docker instead? See [Docker](#docker-alternative-deployment) above —
updates there work by pulling a new image tag.

> **Note:** the product name is PVE-UPS, but service and paths are technically named
> `pve-usv` (`systemctl status pve-usv`, `/etc/pve-usv/config.yaml`,
> `/var/lib/pve-usv/`). This is intentional and keeps existing installations compatible.

## Developing / testing without hardware

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                       # unit tests, no hardware needed

# simulate an SNMP UPS (separate terminal); snapshots in ./snmpdata/:
snmpsim-command-responder --data-dir=./snmpdata --agent-udpv4-endpoint=127.0.0.1:1161

# ... or simulate a NUT server:
python -m tests.nutsim --port 3493 --scenario battery   # mains | battery | low | sparse

PVE_USV_CONFIG=./dev-config.yaml PVE_USV_DB=./dev-events.db python -m app.main
# UI: http://127.0.0.1:8080
#   SNMP: host 127.0.0.1, port 1161, community "public"  -> mains (100 %)
#                                    community "battery" -> outage -> triggers fire
#         The APC snapshots carry PowerNet OIDs only, i.e. a card without RFC 1628:
#                                    community "apc"         -> mains, MIB resolves to APC
#                                    community "apc-battery"  -> outage on the APC MIB
#   NUT:  host 127.0.0.1, port 3493, UPS name "ups"
```

## Limits / assumptions

- Hosts are shut down **individually**, each through its own API. Nodes of a cluster work
  as targets (one datacenter-wide token covers them all), but PVE-UPS does not touch the
  **HA manager or quorum** and resolves no dependencies between nodes — a possible future
  extension.
- Reads the standard RFC 1628 UPS MIB, the APC PowerNet MIB, or a NUT server's variables.
  Other vendor MIBs are not implemented yet — a device outside those needs either RFC 1628
  or a NUT driver. There is no direct USB/serial support in the appliance itself; a locally
  attached UPS is reached through a NUT server.
- The NUT protocol is unencrypted. Use it inside a trusted network, or point it at an
  `upsd` listening on the loopback interface of the same machine.
- In the optional Docker deployment, in-app updates and NTP/timezone management are not
  available (see [Docker](#docker-alternative-deployment)) — everything else is identical.
