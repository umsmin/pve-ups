"""Proxmox VE cluster awareness: Ceph maintenance flags and HA arm/disarm.

Shutting a whole cluster down needs three things the per-node shutdown cannot do:

* On a hyper-converged cluster every guest has to stop BEFORE the first node loses
  power. Letting each node stop its own guests as it goes down looks tidy but hangs:
  with ``size=3/min_size=2`` the pool falls below ``min_size`` once the second node's
  OSDs are gone, the guests still running on the survivor block on IO, their shutdown
  never completes and that node never powers off. The official procedure
  (``pveceph_shutdown``) therefore stops all Ceph clients first,
* Ceph must be told not to start healing while the OSDs disappear one by one
  (``noout,nobackfill,norecover,norebalance``), and
* the HA manager must be disarmed, or it recovers services onto nodes that are
  themselves being powered off. With ``resource-mode=ignore`` the guests leave HA
  tracking and ``pve-guests`` shuts them down in their configured order — that
  handover is exactly what ``PVE::HA::Config::vm_is_ha_managed`` implements by
  returning false while disarmed in that mode. ``freeze`` does NOT do this: the
  guests stay HA-managed, ``pve-guests`` skips them and the disarmed LRM no longer
  stops them, so they would be killed by the power-off. Hence ignore, hard-wired.

Every entry point here is *total*, exactly like app/targets.py: it never raises and
never runs longer than its timeout. This runs on the poll loop while the battery is
draining, so a cluster that accepts a connection and then goes quiet must not be able
to stall the shutdown of anything else.

Order matters and is not the order of the switches: HA disarm, then the guests, then
the flags. Disarming last would let the HA manager restart every guest as fast as it is
stopped; setting the flags first would leave them on if the guest stop then fails.

Availability differs per feature, so they are checked separately rather than gated on
a version number: the Ceph flags work on PVE 8.x, while ``disarm-ha`` arrived with
PVE 9.2. Detection is done on the endpoint index (works with backports too), never by
comparing ``GET /version``.
