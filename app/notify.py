"""Optional notifications: any number of webhooks.

Notifications are best-effort: a failure to notify must never affect the shutdown
logic, so every send is wrapped and only logged on error. The webhooks are sent
concurrently and reported one by one, so a target that accepts the connection and then
goes quiet cannot delay its peers — or the poll loop this runs on.

The payload shape is selectable (see config.WebhookFormat). Every format is one entry in
FORMATTERS, rendering a notification into keyword arguments for ``httpx.post`` — a new
target system is a table row, not new plumbing. Message texts are English only.
