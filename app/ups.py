"""SNMP poller for the UPS, plus the source-neutral state objects.

Reads the standard RFC 1628 UPS-MIB, which network UPS cards implement vendor-
independently — or a vendor MIB where the standard is not enough. Which one is a per-UPS
setting (``SnmpConfig.mib``); the default ``auto`` reads RFC 1628 and switches to a vendor
MIB when the device answers it. See ``MibProfile`` below. Supports SNMP v1/v2c (community)
and v3 (authPriv). Pure-Python via pysnmp, no external net-snmp binaries required.

``UpsState``, ``ProbeEntry`` and ``ProbeResult`` live here but are *not* SNMP-specific:
they are the contract every UPS source produces (see app/sources.py for the dispatch and
app/nut.py for the second implementation). The engine only ever sees these, which is why
the whole trigger/policy/fail-safe machinery is transport-independent.

A failed/timed-out poll yields ``reachable = False`` and never produces a
shutdown-worthy state: loss of communication with the UPS is treated as an alarm, not as
a power failure (fail safe, not fail shutdown).

# not at all — see the APC profile for a documented example. Adding a vendor is a table
# here, a member in config.SnmpMib and two i18n keys; no other module changes.
