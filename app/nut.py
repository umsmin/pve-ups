"""Network UPS Tools (NUT) client.

Reads a UPS from any ``upsd`` over TCP (default port 3493) — a NAS with its built-in UPS
server, a Raspberry Pi, an existing NUT box, or the driver bundled with this appliance.
That covers USB and serial UPS devices, which have no SNMP card to talk to.

We are strictly a *read-only client*: PVE-UPS never runs ``upsmon``, never registers as a
NUT primary/secondary and never lets NUT decide anything. NUT is used as a device driver;
the shutdown logic, the thresholds and the host policy stay here. Only ``LIST VAR`` is
ever sent, so a compromised appliance cannot command the UPS.

The protocol is a plain line-based TCP dialogue, so no extra dependency is needed:

    > LIST VAR myups
    < BEGIN LIST VAR myups
    < VAR myups ups.status "OL"
    < VAR myups battery.charge "100"
    < END LIST VAR myups

Like the SNMP poller, ``poll()`` never raises: a failure yields ``reachable = False``,
which is an alarm and never a shutdown (fail safe, not fail shutdown).
