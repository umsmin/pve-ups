"""Proxmox VE API client.

Shuts down a node via ``POST /nodes/{node}/status {command: shutdown}`` using an
API token (``user@realm!tokenid``) that only needs the ``Sys.PowerMgmt`` privilege.
Node shutdown lets PVE stop the guests in an orderly fashion according to their own
shutdown configuration, so we do not have to iterate guests ourselves.

Proxmox Backup Server speaks a very similar API but differs in the token header
scheme and in the privilege it checks — that lives in app/pbs.py; the engine reaches
both through app/targets.py and never imports either directly.
