"""Dispatch between the shutdown target types.

The engine shuts down through this module and never imports a specific client, so
adding a target is: a model in config.py (a member of the ``ShutdownTarget`` union),
a module with ``shutdown_node``/``test_connection``, a branch here, and the matching
i18n keys.

Both entry points are *total*: they never raise, and they never run longer than their
timeout. That second guarantee is what keeps the targets independent — one machine
that accepts a connection and then goes quiet must not delay another machine's
shutdown, nor the poll loop that keeps the battery countdown running.
