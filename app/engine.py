"""Decision engine and background poll loop.

Per-UPS state machine (each configured UPS is evaluated independently)::

    ONLINE  ->  ON_BATTERY  ->  (UPS triggered)

A host is shut down based on *its* feeding UPS devices (``HostConfig.ups_ids``) and
its policy (``ups_policy``): ``"all"`` (redundant PSUs — shut down only when every
feed has triggered, the default) or ``"any"`` (shut down as soon as one feed
triggers). A return to mains on any required feed aborts a not-yet-committed shutdown
(hysteresis, no flapping). An unreachable UPS raises an alarm but never triggers a
shutdown on its own (fail safe); a trigger already fired on fresh data, however, stays
latched while the UPS is unreachable (blind = never downgrade). When ``dry_run`` is set, the engine logs what it
*would* do and latches per host until power returns, instead of actually shutting
hosts down.
