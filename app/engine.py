"""Decision engine and background poll loop.

Per-UPS state machine (each configured UPS is evaluated independently)::

    ONLINE  ->  ON_BATTERY  ->  (UPS triggered)

A host is shut down based on *its* feeding UPS devices (``HostConfig.ups_ids``) and
its policy (``ups_policy``): ``"all"`` (redundant PSUs — shut down only when every
feed has triggered, the default) or ``"any"`` (shut down as soon as one feed
triggers). A return to mains on any required feed aborts a not-yet-committed shutdown
(hysteresis, no flapping). An unreachable UPS raises an alarm but never triggers a
shutdown on its own (fail safe); a trigger already fired on fresh data, however, stays
latched while the UPS is unreachable (blind = never downgrade). When ``dry_run`` is set, the engine logs what it
*would* do and latches per host until power returns, instead of actually shutting
hosts down.

    """The worst case, broken down. Pure, so every caller quotes the same figures.

    It counts what actually runs in SEQUENCE, which is what it used to get wrong: one
    host timeout and one cluster preparation, when both are sequential loops. Hosts go in
    stages — everything sharing an ``order`` at once, the appliance's own host alone at
    the end — so four distinct order values cost four timeouts, not one. An operator
    sizes their battery reserve against this figure, and it was several times too small.

    One retry stage is counted, and only one. _evaluate_hosts() gives hosts that failed
    earlier in the sweep a second attempt immediately before the ``this_host`` stage,
    because no poll follows that stage to carry the retry. It runs concurrently, so it
    costs one more host timeout, and it is worth counting for the same reason the stages
    are: the operator sizes a battery reserve against this number.

    The cluster inspection is counted where a cluster is configured: on a cold start (no
    self-test since the last restart, or a configuration saved just before the outage) the
    preparation reads the cluster from inside the shutdown path. Since 4.1.0 that is one
    read per cluster rather than one per node, which is what makes it a term worth naming
    instead of an unbounded one.

    The cluster term follows the switches, not just the tick: the guest stop is the
    largest single number here and it runs only where Ceph was asked for, so it is counted
    only there. Reading it off ``cluster`` alone charged a plain cluster five minutes for a
    step that cannot happen — and the battery-reserve warning below quotes this figure.

    Two things it deliberately does not add. The number of clusters, because a pure
    function over the config cannot know how many distinct clusters those hosts belong to
    (the names come from the API); one is assumed, and a second one doubles the cluster
    term. And the remaining attempts from MAX_SHUTDOWN_ATTEMPTS, because those land one
    poll apart and only after a host has already failed — counting every one of them would
    inflate the normal case threefold to warn about the abnormal one.

        the discovered cluster name in host_states, or the node list the API just gave us.
        The second is the same verbatim name comparison cluster.node_coverage() makes —
        the shutdown call uses the name literally, so anything looser would be a lie.

        configuration in which the action over-reached was the one in which nothing said
        so. One membership rule now, shared by the preparation, the unit additions, the
        preview and the health checks.
