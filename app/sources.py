"""Dispatch between the UPS source types.

The engine polls through this module and never imports a specific source, so adding a
way to read a UPS is: a model in config.py (a member of the ``UpsSource`` union), a
module with ``poll``/``probe``, a branch here, and the matching i18n keys.

Every source produces the same ``UpsState``, which is why the trigger logic, the host
policy, the fail-safe rules and their whole test suite apply unchanged.
